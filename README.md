# Applied Data Science Capstone


## Project scenario
In this capstone, I take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Mask. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

## Tools used
SQL, Python, Sklearn, Folium Lab, Plotly, GitHub, Powerpoint

## Extra

Inside this folder, you will find several Jupyter notebook files from the final assignments of various topics studied during the certification program. While they are not part of the project itself, these assignments were crucial for understanding various technical aspects needed to carry out the project, including:

1. **SQL with Python.ipynb**
Contains code and examples for integrating SQL queries with Python, demonstrating how to perform data manipulation and analysis using SQL within a Python environment.

2. **Statistics with Python.ipynb**
Provides an overview of statistical analysis techniques implemented in Python, covering descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and various statistical tests.

3. **Machine Learning Cuisine Tree Classifier.ipynb**
Includes a machine learning project using a decision tree classifier to categorize different types of cuisine based on various features.

4. **Machine Learning Rain Prediction.ipynb**
Features a machine learning model aimed at predicting rainfall, utilizing historical weather data to forecast future precipitation levels.
