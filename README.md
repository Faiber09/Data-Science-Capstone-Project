# Applied Data Science Capstone
Final assignment 

# Project scenario
In this capstone, I take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX founded by Billionaire industrialist Allon Mask. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
