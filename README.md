# Applied Data Science Capstone


## Project scenario
In this capstone project, I acted as a data scientist for a fictional aerospace company called Space Y, a competitor of SpaceX. My task was to determine the price of space launches by collecting public data using Web Scraping and SQL, and creating dashboards for my team. Additionally, I developed machine learning models to predict whether SpaceX would reuse the first stage of their rockets, comparing the accuracy and effectiveness of various algorithms. This project allowed me to apply advanced data science and machine learning techniques in a real-world context and prepare reports for stakeholders.

## Tools used
